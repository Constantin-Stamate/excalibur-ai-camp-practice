# Excalibur AI Camp – Homework Collection

This repository contains the homework assignments completed as part of the **Excalibur AI Camp**, an educational program focused on **Machine Learning**, **Python programming**, and data analysis tools such as **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

## Structure

The project is organized into four main folders, each corresponding to a lesson from the camp:

```
lesson_1/     # General Python tasks and exercises
lesson_4/     # Homework covering basics of NumPy
lesson_5/     # Introduction to Pandas – Series and DataFrames
lesson_6/     # Data analysis projects using Pandas
```

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks relevant to that lesson's subject.

## Technologies & Topics Covered

-  Python (core syntax, control structures, functions)
-  NumPy (arrays, indexing, broadcasting, mathematical operations)
-  Pandas (Series, DataFrames, filtering, aggregation)
-  Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding

## How to Run

1. **Install Python (3.8 or later)**  
Download and install Python from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


2. **Clone the repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Constantin-Stamate/Excalibur_AI_Camp.git
```

3. **Navigate into the project folder**

```bash
  cd Excalibur_AI_Camp
```

4. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**

```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

5. **Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

6. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
  pip install notebook
```

7. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
  jupyter notebook
```

Then open the desired `.ipynb` file from the lesson folders.

## About the Camp

**Excalibur AI Camp** is an intensive training program focused on real-world applications of Python in data science and machine learning. Throughout the course, participants covered topics including:

- Python basics and scripting
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Data preprocessing and transformation techniques
- Building and evaluating simple machine learning models

Each lesson included hands-on assignments to reinforce the concepts through practice and real datasets.
